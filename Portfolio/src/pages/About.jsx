          <h3>Hello, I'm Kaarthaveerya Arjun</h3>
          <p>
            I’m a self-taught artist and visual storyteller, crafting art that weaves myth, nature, and emotion into one flowing canvas.
            My journey began not in a studio, but under trees, near rivers, and amidst wandering thoughts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each piece I create is a quiet rebellion against chaos, a celebration of slowness, and an offering to beauty and memory.
            My works often reflect tribal essence, folk memories, divine femininity, and forest symbolism.
          </p>
          <p>
            Welcome to my world — not just to view art, but to feel it.

          <h3>Why I chose "Kaarthaveerya Arjun" as my pen name?</h3>
          <br />
          <p>            
            Once upon a time, there lived a King — a King with a Thousand Arms. People called him Sahasra Baahu.
            But his real name is....... wait.

            The story begins in Vaikunta, the divine abode of Lord Vishnu. Lord Vishnu was preparing for his next incarnation on Earth. His loyal vahana, right hand man, Garuda, was also readying himself for reincarnation. His left hand man, Adi Sesha — the serpent with thousand heads — too, prepared for his next life. Even his consort, Goddess Lakshmi, was ready to descend. Vishnu’s gatekeepers, Jaya and Vijaya, were also destined to be reborn.

            <br />
            <br />

            Then came Sudarshana Chakra, Lord Vishnu’s mighty weapon, with a forlorn expression.
            He asked, "Swamy, if you are leaving for Earth, what purpose would I serve here without you? Let me reincarnate and come with you."

            Lord Vishnu smiled and said, "How could I ever leave you behind? You too shall be born to a King on Earth — as a human, with a thousand arms."

            And thus, Sahasra Baahu was born.

            His real name is....... wait.

            <br />
            <br />



            When I first read this story, I was awe-struck by the idea of being born with a thousand arms.
            Imagine — with a thousand arms, a King could rule the entire world. And that's exactly what Sahasra Baahu did — he became the King of the World.

            His real name is .......wait.

            <br />
            <br />

            I thought to myself, "What if I had a thousand arms?"
            I would create hundreds of artworks every day, write countless stories through my illustrations, and become the greatest artist in the world.

            I love storytelling. I love painting. I love creating worlds through my art.
            This story inspired me to choose that name.........Sahasra Baahu’s real name as my pen name.

            His real name is KAARTHAVEERYA ARJUNA.
